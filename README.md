# 🛡️ ThreatClassifierAgent
> An LLM-powered Autonomous Cyber Threat Detection Agent using LangChain, Pandas, and OpenRouter-compatible LLMs.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**ThreatClassifierAgent** is an AI-powered automation that analyzes network packets and classifies them as *benign* or *malicious*. It uses:
- LLMs for semantic classification
- A Retrieval QA chain (RAG)
- Custom agents built using LangChain
- Packet-level insights via DataFrame parsing

Ideal for automating cybersecurity workflows in real-time or batch settings.
